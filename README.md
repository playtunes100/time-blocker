# Time Blocker

## Description

This is a Reactjs implementation of a time blocking planner called [Tactical Time Blocker](https://jessej.gumroad.com/l/timeblocker).\
It helps plan your day by setting aside a chunks of time to focus on a single task.

## Why

I decided to make this because:
* I liked the planner but most of my planning is done on my phone or laptop.
* By implementing it this way i can use the Notion API and sync it to my existing kanban boards.
* It helps increase productivity.
* Demonstrates abitlity to turn design into code.
